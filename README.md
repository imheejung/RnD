# Data-driven Analysis on the Performance Evaluation of National R&D Projects in Korea

To identify the factors that influence the efficiency of national R&D investments, we studied whether the characteristics of national R&D projects, research stages, technology types, and management institutions, have notable effects on the performance of them. We conducted the factorial Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by a post hoc test using Dunnâ€™s Test.
